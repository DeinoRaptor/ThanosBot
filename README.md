# Thanos is on Discord now!!!

## Important warning

This bot has the ability to let ANYONE with ADMIN or BAN USERS permission BAN anyone on the server! Use caution when using this, or don't use it at all!

OTHER WARNING: This bot ALSO has the ability to ban RANDOM USERS! Once again, use at your own risk!!!

## How to use

Summon Thanos by calling him. Type his name before your message ("Thanos " + whatever) or @ him ("@Thanos " + whatever)
*He will tell you all of his commands that way.*

__Thanos can:__

* ban: just specify whomst you want to ban and he will bring balance at your request
* spare: specify whomst you want to spare and he will say they are spared. However their fate may change... (aka they can still get banned)
* snap: Thanos will snap his fingers to bring instant balance to the number of users on your server (excluding admins and bots I think)

Requires nodejs

After getting nodejs and setting up npm and all, retrieve the code, then cd into the folder containing the code, then run:
